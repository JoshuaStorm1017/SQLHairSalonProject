# SQL Hair Salon Database Management Project

## Overview
This project was developed as the final project for the Data Process & Modeling class. It involves the design and implementation of a SQL database system tailored to meet the specific needs of a hair salon. The project simulates real-world operations by creating multiple tables populated with data.

## Features

- Initial creation of multiple tables representing different aspects of a hair salon's operations.
- Developed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to enforce data integrity and referential integrity constraints.
- Defined a set of business rules governing the database's functionality.
- Executed key queries that perform tasks such as:
  - Calculating order totals with and without member or promotion discounts.
  - Identifying mismatched credit card information.
  - Summarizing total sales by individual stores.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/JoshuaStorm1017/SQLHairSalonProject/).
2. Run the SQL scripts to set up the database and tables.
3. Execute the queries to interact with the database.
